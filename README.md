# Humanoid-Hand_Arduino
Humanoid hand that mimics what my finger does. Made flex sensors using aluminum foils. Used servos, strings, and tubes to make the fingers. 


The reciever is the robot hand. the transmitter is my hand. The transmitter collects data on what fingers are bent and sends that information to the robot, where the servos adject to certain positions to mimic my fingers.
